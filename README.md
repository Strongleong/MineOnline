Launch old versions of minecraft just as you remembered them.

## What is MineOnline?
MineOnline is a launcher Minecraft capable of running web applets without a browser, and redirecting web requests to a new API.

For example, if you wanted to play classic right now, you'd have no way to launch it without a lot of outdated vulnerable software and luck. And even if you pulled it off, you'd be running a stipped down version of the game, with no skins, no server authentication and no online map saving. MineOnline fixes this.

The program can also run regular desktop versions of the game, and even old launchers.

**Compatible with Java 8u261+**

## Launching Servers
If you'd like to launch a server to authenticate using a different API, you can do so with the following launch command.

`-cp <MineOnline.jar path> gg.codie.mineonline.Server <server jar path> [server main class] [server arguments]`

For example, the typical launch command

```java  -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar```

becomes

```java -cp MineOnline.jar gg.codie.mineonline.Server minecraft_server.jar -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M```

If you don't want your server to appear on the list, set `public: false` in `server.properties`.

You can optionally provide a "serverlist-ip" and or "serverlist-port" in your server.properties, if you'd like a different IP/port to be listed.

## For Modders
You can add custom version information to the launcher by creating a version info file at `.mineonline\custom-version-info\`.
The file should be in a directory named client or server, and it's name should contain the version name and md5.
For example:
`.mineonline\custom-version-info\client\Skylands 0.1 F8F78A4ED4033547CC1EA28C776DA7AE.json`
This file should contain an array of JSON versions, like this:

```json
{ 
  "name": "Skylands 0.1", 
  "md5": "F8F78A4ED4033547CC1EA28C776DA7AE", 
  "type": "client",
  "baseVersion": "b1.7.3",
  "info": "Beta 1.7.3 mod",
  "legacy": true
}
```

Legacy is true for any pre-1.6 minecraft version.
For 1.6 and above, libraries should be provided. Examples can be found [here](https://github.com/codieradical/MineOnline/blob/master/res/version-info/client/).

I recommend you start with the unmodded version information as a template, as most of the settings will carry over.

If you would like a version to be added to the main list, contact me (Codie).
